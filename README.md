# QuadTree-SFML
Quadtree collision detection with C++ and SFML for my personal project

implementation.txt contains how I implemented quad tree collision detection in my own project,
so depending on what kind of project of you have you might not even need to use the code in implementation.txt
but it should give you a brief idea on how to use the class

Dont forget to instantiate the class
the boundary value in the constructor should be "0,0,windowSize.x,windowSize.y"

The QuadTree class is very generic, so use the Point class in Quadtree.h to your own needs and change for your own personal project

Have Fun :)
